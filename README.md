- Layout switches from horizontal to vertical on smaller devices (`max-width: 520px`), improving usability on mobile phones.

### ðŸ”¡ Scalable Typography & Spacing
- Typography and spacing for key elements like `.score`, `.name`, and `.player` are scaled appropriately for better readability.

### ðŸŽ® Adaptive Button Design
- Button positions (`.btn--roll`, `.btn--hold`, `.btn--new`) and sizes are adjusted to remain accessible and visually consistent on smaller screens.

### ðŸŽ² Dice Responsiveness
- The diceâ€™s position and size adapt to maintain visual balance across devices.

### ðŸŒŸ Visual Enhancements
- Shadows and padding are optimized for performance and aesthetics on low-resolution displays.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
